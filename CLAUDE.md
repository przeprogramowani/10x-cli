# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

Early scaffold for the `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli`. Most commands are deliberate stubs that exit via `exitNotImplemented` and reference the phase in which they land. The full roadmap lives at `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-04-07-10x-cli-design.md` (in the sibling `10x-toolkit` repo, not in this one). When asked to implement something, check that plan first to understand which phase the work belongs to and what envelope/exit-code conventions apply.

## Commands

Runtime is **Bun** (≥ Node 20 declared in `package.json` for the published binary, but local dev uses Bun directly).

```bash
bun install
bun run dev -- <args>      # run CLI from source, e.g. `bun run dev -- --help`
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint               # oxlint (config in .oxlintrc.json)
bun test                   # bun:test runner; tests live in tests/
bun test tests/smoke.test.ts   # single file
bun run build              # node-target ESM bundle → dist/index.mjs
bun run build:binary       # standalone compiled binary → dist/10x (~59MB)
bun run generate-types     # refetch /openapi.json → src/generated/api-types.ts
```

`generate-types` hits the production delivery API by default. To regenerate against a local backend: `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 bun run generate-types`. The same env var is read at CLI runtime by `resolveApiBase()` to point the CLI at a non-production API.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck → lint → test → build → build:binary on every PR. Anything that breaks one of those steps will block merge.

## Architecture

The CLI is a thin **CAC**-based command dispatcher (`src/index.ts`) that wires command modules into a single `cac("10x")` instance and parses argv. Three concerns are factored into `src/lib/`:

- **`api-client.ts`** — typed `fetch` wrapper for the 10x-toolkit delivery API. Returns a discriminated `ApiResult<T>` (`{ ok: true, data }` | `{ ok: false, code, error }`) — callers **must** branch on `ok` and surface failures via `outputError`. Network errors collapse to `code: "network_error"`, status `0`. The HTTP surface is described by `src/generated/api-types.ts`, which is generated from `/openapi.json` and committed to git; never hand-edit it.
- **`config.ts`** — XDG-compliant local credential store at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/10x-cli/auth.json` (Windows: `%APPDATA%/10x-cli/auth.json`). `saveAuth` writes atomically via `tmp` + `renameSync` with mode `0o600`, and `AuthData` is versioned (`AUTH_FILE_VERSION = 1`) — bumping the schema means bumping the version and handling the older payload in `readAuth`.
- **`output.ts`** — the I/O contract every command must follow. Three rules to internalize:
  1. **Stdout is reserved for data; humans read stderr.** `output()` writes JSON to stdout *or* a human message to stderr — never both.
  2. **JSON mode is implied when stdout is not a TTY**, even without `--json`. `resolveContext()` handles this; commands should always go through it instead of checking flags directly.
  3. **Exit codes are semantic** (`ExitCodes`): `0` SUCCESS, `1` ERROR, `2` USAGE, `3` AUTH_REQUIRED, `4` FORBIDDEN, `5` NOT_FOUND. Use `outputError(ctx, code, message, exitCode, hint)` rather than `process.exit` ad-hoc, so the JSON envelope `{ status: "error", error: { code, message, hint } }` stays consistent.

Each command in `src/commands/` exports a `register*Command(cli)` function that attaches itself to the shared CAC instance. Adding a new command means: create `src/commands/foo.ts` exporting `registerFooCommand`, import + call it in `src/index.ts`. Action callbacks receive their positional args followed by an options object that already includes the global `--json` / `--verbose` flags — pass that object straight into `resolveContext` / `outputError`.

Stub commands intentionally call `exitNotImplemented(name, phase, options)` so machine consumers still get a parseable error envelope. When implementing a phase, replace that call rather than working around it.

## Testing

- Test runner: `bun test` (not vitest, not Jest)
- Imports: `import { describe, it, expect, mock } from "bun:test"`
- Module mocks: use `mock.module()` from `bun:test`, not `vi.mock`
- Prefer dependency injection over module mocking where possible
- Run tests with `bun test`, not `vitest run` or `npx jest`

## Conventions worth knowing

- TypeScript is `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`. Index access on arrays/records returns `T | undefined` — handle it.
- Generated code lives under `src/generated/` and is excluded from oxlint via `.oxlintrc.json`.
- The CAC parser throws on unknown options; `src/index.ts` catches that and exits `2` (USAGE) with an `ERROR usage:` prefix on stderr. Preserve this behavior — it's how scripts detect bad invocations.
- The CLI's user-agent is hard-coded to `"10x-cli"` in `api-client.ts`.
